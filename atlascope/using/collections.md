# Using Atlascope to find urban atlas plates in the BPL collections

## Context

While using mosaiced atlas layers inside the Atlascope app is an intuitive way to access the materials, we understand there will certainly be cases where you wish to access high-resolution scans of individual atlas plates, and thus will need to be able to locate these unique items in our [digital collections](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/ "Digital collections").

Or maybe, you even wish to visit the Map Center, and [research](https://www.leventhalmap.org/research/ "Research @ LMEC") with particular atlas plates in person!

For these reasons, we have designed Atlascope to work symbiotically with our traditional library interfaces, specifically our digital collections and collection-level research guides for the historical urban atlas collection.

In this guide you will learn how to use Atlascope to quickly find atlas plates in the digital collections.

## Steps

1). Use the location or address-based search to find a location.

2). Zoom in close to the area of interest.

3). Use the menus to select the appropriate atlas year.

4). From the app layer controls, select "About this map"

Here, you will find bibliographic information about the volume, and will be presented with three options for finding this resource in the library collections.

`View the catalog record` will bring you to the item record in the Boston Public Library's digital catalog.

`View individual plates in the Digital Collections` will bring you to a query in the digital collections returning all results for plates associated with that volume's call number. This will essentially be a gallery of thumbnails. You will still need to page through the results to find the plate with the location of interest.

5). The most useful option is to select `View plate boundaries and atlas extent`.

Here, you will find tiles for only the volume at hand, and plate extent boundaries.

A pop-up will appear with bibliographic information, including a link to the item in the digital collections.
