# Finding atlases by location


## Dynamic menus

Each historical atlas included in the project has a different geographic coverage. This is because the atlases were created for different towns and areas, at a time when the urban landscape was developing rapidly. For these reasons, no two atlases in our collection have exactly the same geographic extent.

Rather than limit browsing to a selection from a long list of atlas layers, our project allows you to find layers based on where you are on the map.


The app has been designed so that you can pan and zoom around a modern street map or satellite imagery, and the app will automatically find all layers that are available for that particular location.

!> **As you move** around the map, the dropdown menus with available **atlas layers will change** and update to reflect what is available for that area.

As you move out of the range of one atlas, the app will automatically suggest the oldest atlas layer available for the new map location.

## Atlases available

There are some handy indicators built in to let you know how many atlas layers are currently available to you at the particular location you are interacting with.

On the right-hand side of the menu, please find an icon alert with the number of available atlas layers for any location.

## Find me tool

From the Atlascope home screen, select `Find me` to find your current location and return historical atlas layers available for that location.

If you want the app to follow your path as you meander through Boston, select `Follow` in response to the prompt "Do you want the map to move with you?"

The `Find me` + `Follow` combination is fun to try on foot or on the MBTA!

If you would like to find your location initially as a point of reference, and then turn off all subsequent tracking, select `No` to when asked if you want the map to move with you.

> You will need to enable location services on your device for the Find me tool to work. The Leventhal Map & Education Center does not record any of the location data; location services are required only to enable the Find me tool to work as you explore the city.


## All atlases in app

To access a list of all atlases available in the app, please follow the steps below.

!> **Zoom out on the map** by using your computer cursor, or by pinching the screen on your touch device. Eventually, the tiles will disappear, and polygon shapes representing each available atlas layer will appear.

To return to a historical map layer, you have two options.

1). Using the map interface to zoom back in on an area.

2). From the polygon extent interface, expanding the "Choose an atlas..." menu to find a list of all available app layers.

Selecting one of the list options will turn tiles on for that layer.

Atlascope includes a selection of the town, county and urban atlases available at the Boston Public Library. To learn more about the full research collection, please find the [All urban atlases @ the BPL guide.](geoservices.leventhalmap.org/docs/#/atlascope/using/all-atlases "All atlases @ BPL")
