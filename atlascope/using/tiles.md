# Using layer tiles

One of the benefits of creating high-quality tiles for this project, is the ability to share them with you!

We are excited to share the app we have created for exploring these atlases, but we also encourage you to try using these atlas tiles in projects of your own.

The tiles for each volume are accessible by selecting `About this map` and then copying the link under `XYZ Tile Endpoint`

This link can be brought into any geospatial software -- desktop software like ArcMap, ArcGIS Pro, and QGIS, cloud mapping platforms like ArcGIS Online, Carto and Google Maps, and you can even use them to build your own Javascript web apps, like we did with Atlascope!

For any questions centered on using these tiles as layers in your own project, or any questions related to geospatial data and mapping, please do not hesitate to reach out to us via our [geospatial research form.](https://leventhalmap.org/research/geospatial-data "Geospatial Research @ LMEC")
