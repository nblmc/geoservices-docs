# All urban atlases at the BPL

## Overview

While Atlascope includes an amazing number of atlases from the BPL collections covering Boston and surrounding towns, it does not include a significant portion of atlases available for research at the BPL.

**Atlases not included in Atlascope**

- Atlases outside of Boston Proper for most towns in Massachusetts.

- Atlases published after 1923 where rights are still retained by the copyright owner. This includes most of the twentieth-century Sanborns.

Though you cannot access these important archives in the app or digital collections quite yet, you **_can_** research with them in person. Here's how:

1). Submit a reference request using our [research form.](https://www.leventhalmap.org/research/ "Research @ LMEC")

2). Use our libguides to find a complete record of what's available.


## Using the libguides

1). Navigate to the [Historical Urban Atlases of Boston Libguide.](https://guides.bpl.org/urban-atlases "Urban Atlas Libguide")

This guide provides information about all atlases of Boston available at the BPL.

2). To find a list of citations organized by neighborhood and chronology, select `List of Urban Atlases`.
