# Comparison tools

There are a few different tools available in the app to compare historical atlases.

You can control the overlay appearance by switching between Glass, Swipe, or Opacity modes.

## Glass

The default overlay mode in the app is the `Glass mode`, named so for its resemblance to a spyglass.

This mode provides a neat way to "peer through" the baselayer to whichever atlas is selected inside the Glass view.

We tend to think of `Glass mode` as a rather convenient way to use Atlascope, because of the ability to increase or decrease the size of the glass, allowing total customization of the comparison between the baselayer and the glass map.

Glass mode can be activated at any time by selecting "Glass" from the app menu controls.

## Swipe

Another mode available is `Swipe mode`.

You can change the direction of the swipe by toggling between `Swipe Y` and `Swipe X` in the app menu controls.

## Opacity

The final available overlay mode is `Opacity mode`.

`Opacity mode` can be activated at any time by selecting `Opacity` in the menu layer controls.

In addition to using the range slider to gradually increase or decrease opacity, try selecting "0" or "100" on either end of the slider to quickly toggle the overlay off and on.

## Change over time


Try setting both the base and overlay layers to historic atlases. What comparisons can you make that show how the city has changed?

Let's compare a few blocks in South Boston between 1885 and 1891...
