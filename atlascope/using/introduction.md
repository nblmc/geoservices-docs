# Introduction

## Context

Atlascope is a web app for exploring and browsing the rich collection of urban atlases held at the Boston Public Library.

For researching urban history in the US, **urban atlases**, like the ones that were produced for fire insurance surveys, are some of the most important resources. But because these atlases are physically clumsy, and broken up page-by-page into areas covering usually only a few city blocks, it’s not always easy to find what you’re looking for, and even more difficult to compare across time.

Thanks to a grant from the [Council on Library and Information Resources](https://www.clir.org/ "CLIR"), we’ve been taking our urban atlases and transforming them into continuous, zoomable web layers. That takes a ton of hand labor identifying control points and mosaicing the pages together at their boundaries, a process which our interns have been taking on with great zeal. (for more on how this process works, please find our [Creating atlas tiles guide.](https://geoservices.leventhalmap.org/docs/#/atlascope/creating/introduction "Creating atlas tiles guides")

On top of that GIS work, we’ve built a brand new web interface which automatically pulls up the atlases which cover an area you’re interested in. Atlascope allows you to compare historic atlases to one another and to modern maps, and then find the original items in the library collections. It’s an amazing resource for anyone interested in exploring how Boston has changed over time.

This guide will walk through some of the ways Atlascope can help you use the urban atlas collection at the Boston Public Library.

Atlascope was developed at the Leventhal Map & Education Center at the Boston Public Library by Garrett Dash Nelson and Belle Lipton. Atlas layers were prepared by a team of interns including Ian Donnelly, Hanaan Yazdi, Abby Duker, Rachel Mead, Luwei Chen, Brian Kominick, Madison Bastress, Liz Kellam and Victoria Mak.

Digitization and preparation of atlas layers was made possible by the [Council on Library and Information Resources.](https://www.clir.org/ "CLIR")

Leventhal Map & Education Center at the Boston Public Library, together with the bibliographic information for the map(s) used, which is available in the "About this Map" tab from the map window view.
