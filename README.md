# LMEC Documentation Base

Welcome to the documentation base for all geospatial activities of the Norman B. Leventhal Map & Education Center at the Boston Public Library. 

Here, you will find guides on a number of topics, ranging from simple, step-by-step instructions for completing basic GIS tasks, to detailed
documentation for some of the more complex geospatial activities here at the Map Center, like creating zoomable web
maps from the dusty atlas books sitting in your library's basement! 

Are you a librarian wishing to open access to your collections?
Work at a non-profit and interested in how mapping can help you understand more about the populations you serve?
Just curious about what the heck GIS is, and want to learn more? These guides and the team of people behind them are here for you.

We genuinely believe if someone can think it, you can know it. At times, GIS can be confusing; it can be
frustrating when our computers aren't doing what we want them to do, or we feel like we don't have the 
technical vocabulary to even search for the problem we are encountering. 


At the Map Center, we don't have the answer to every GIS question, but we probably know some good places to start. 
We have assembled these guides as an ever-growing resource of written material on our GIS activities here at the 
Map Center. 

It's likely these guides may answer only part, or even none of your question, and that's okay, because
it's an opportunity for us to talk to you! In addition to online guides, the Map Center offers one-on-one
help, which we can do over the phone, in person, or via email. 

Here are the best ways to get in touch with us, if you are working on a particular project, hoping to find out more
