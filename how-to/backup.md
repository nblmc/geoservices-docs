# Backup

When you have finished processing an atlas the backup file structure should look as follows:

**Maps Center Drive:**

`Maps Center → GEOSPATIAL →  urban-atlases →  barcode`

The Maps Center drive should be backed up only with the vector data that has resulted from this project. Any other files, especially imagery, should be cleaned out, after ensuring all of the imagery files are backed up in their proper locations.

Footprints should be saved as geoJSONs. 


**External Harddrive:**

All atlas data should be backed up here with the following structure:
