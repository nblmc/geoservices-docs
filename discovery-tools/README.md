# Discovery Tools Guides Homepage

The Leventhal Map & Education Center are proud stewards of the Boston Public Library's cartographic collections.
In number, this collection entails upwards of 200,000 maps and 5,000 atlases. What this means is we are tasked with caring for and providing access to archives 
packed with more stories and histories than one person could ever learn or explore. 

Some prevalent themes found in these collections are the movement of peoples, changes in place and ideology,
histories of New England and Massachusetts and the study of cartography as an artistic and scientific discipline.

A **core value** of the Leventhal Map & Education Center is our commitment to facilitating the utmost possible access to these collections.

We select digital initiatives based on what we think would best bridge the gap between the resources you are the most 
interested in, and the barriers standing between you and these materials.

This ever-growing set of written guides on the discovery tools we have developed will serve as complementary pals to the tools themselves, and will come in handy when learning how to make the most out of their use.

If you have questions beyond what is contained in these guides about the Map Center's digital discovery tools, or would
like to schedule staff trainings or community events centered on their use, please do not hesitate to email or call directly:
