# Data Guides Homepage

Here at the Map Center, we work with data in a number of capacities. We:

 - **create** data for use with our own projects
 - **locate** already-existent geospatial data for people during one-on-one reference consulations
 - we sometimes **process** that data so it's easier and more useful for us and others to work with 
 - we keep an **archive** or snapshot of important local data, ensuring it is preserved in the long-term and we
 - **acquire** data from amazing cartographers when adding new print and digital work to our collections


Another big way we work with data at the Map Center is through our educational work. By attending our workshops and gallery exhibitions, you will encounter everything from data basics including how to find data and what that weird column name stands for, to bigger,
weightier questions about data and the impact it can have on our lives (check out our upcoming exhibition, [Bending Lines](https://www.leventhalmap.org/exhibitions/#upcoming "Bending Lines"), opening this upcoming May 2020)

The geospatial and statistical data we create, collect, preserve, describe, and help locate refer to specific types or formats of **information**. We believe the public library is a great place to get free access to information, so we have put together a list of some of the ways you can explore **data services available at the Map Center**:


1. As we develop better search tools for sharing all of the data we make and collect, we will keep you in the loop.
In the meantime, you can preview data from some of our recent projects [here](https://github.com/nblmc/geodata "here").

2. Stay tuned to our [calendar](https://www.leventhalmap.org/calendar "calendar") to keep track of our regularly occurring workshops centered on the themes of mapping and geospatial data. 

3. For one-on-one help with a specific mapping project, including where to find the data you will need, or how to work with or create your own data, please fill out our [Geospatial Reference Request Form](https://www.leventhalmap.org/research/geospatial-data/ "Geospatial Reference Request Form").
