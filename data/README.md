# Data Guides Homepage

At the Map Center, we are constantly working with data. We **make** data in our own projects,
we **locate** already-existent data for people during one-on-one help,
we sometimes **process** that data so it's easier to work with, we keep an **archive** of important local data, and we **acquire** data from amazing cartographers when adding their work to our collections. 

We also love teaching with data. By attending our workshops and gallery exhibitions, you will encounter everything from data basics including how to find data and what that weird column means, to bigger,
weightier questions about data and how it impacts our lives (check out our upcoming exhibition, [Bending Lines](https://www.leventhalmap.org/exhibitions/#upcoming "Bending Lines"), opening this May)

'Data' is essentially a word that means information, and call us old fashioned, but we believe the public library is a great
place to get free access to information. 

Here are some ways to explore **data services available at the Map Center**:

1. As we develop better search tools for sharing all of the data we make and collect, we will keep you in the loop.
In the meantime, you can preview data from some of our recent projects [here](https://github.com/nblmc/geodata "here").

2. For classes on data basics, stay tuned to our [calendar](https://www.leventhalmap.org/calendar "calendar").

3. For one-on-one help with a specific mapping project, including where to find the data you will need, or how to work with or create your own data, please fill out our [Geospatial Reference Request Form](https://www.leventhalmap.org/research/geospatial-data/ "Geospatial Reference Request Form").
