## Repo 

  Technically, the story will still work even if you mix these up, since LMEC Digital Collections and Digital Commonwealth are actually the same system. This field only affects which interface the user will get pointed to when they click the “View this item” button. 

  ## Sequence

  The sequence field exists so that in the next version of the viewer, we can deal with objects that have multiple images for the same record entry.
