## IIIF

IIIF (International Image Interoperability Framework) or, "Triple-I-F", is  a framework that defines standards for delivering images over the web. It was created to encourage interoperability between disparate institutions' image repositories.

## Repo 

Technically, the story will still work even if you mix these up, since LMEC Digital Collections and Digital Commonwealth are actually the same system. This field only affects which interface the user will get pointed to when they click the “View this item” button. 

## Sequence

The sequence field exists so that in the next version of the viewer, we can deal with objects that have multiple images for the same record entry. 

## Making updates

Click through to the URL for the new story to see it live. If you need to make edits, go back to your Google Sheet, and then begin again at Publishing step 3 here, using the same “Tour Identifier” 

The Google Sheet and the published Map Story are not inherently connected to each other. The “Map Story Generator” tool acts as a bridge between Google Sheets and the Map Stories. Every time you make a change in your Google Sheet, you’ll have to run the Map Story Generator again to update an existing story or create a new one. Similarly, if you delete your Google Sheet, the Map Story will still exist.
