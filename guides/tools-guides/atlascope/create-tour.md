# Atlascope Tour Instructions {docsify-ignore}

Atlascope Tours are interpretive overlays on our urban atlas discovery portal, Atlascope. Tours are a great way to present a series of locations in Atlascope, delving into the rich histories embedded in these materials, and can be centered on either geography (e.g., “Egleston Square”) or topic (“Brickyards of Cambridge”). 

## To make an Atlascope Tour... {docsify-ignore}

### You will need: {docsify-ignore}
1. A browser tab open to [Atlascope](https://atlascope.leventhalmap.org/ "Atlascope") <br>
2. Somewhere to gather your captions and view links, like a Word or Google doc, or the Thematic Atlascope Outreach Notes Hub, if you are creating Official LMEC Atlascope Tours
3. A Google Sheet; make a copy of [this template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1InOSNPjhbA7b8QOJsCv_2B1vIaFf6Zv_J2ckCzLDb20/edit?usp=sharing "this template"). Each row, or "stop" on the tour needs a share link for that particular view from Atlascope, along with a caption. 


### Generate location links for each stop: {docsify-ignore}

1. In Atlascope, navigate to the location you wish to portray 
2. Select the overlay mode and base layer of your choice
3. From the Share menu, select "Share this specific view". This is the URL you will use to populate the URL field in the Google sheet. 


### Populate stops in the Google sheet: {docsify-ignore}
1. In your copy of the Google sheet template, enter the Share URL and caption for each stop. 


### Publishing: {docsify-ignore}

1. The “Create a custom Atlascope tour” tool creates a tour from your Google Sheet. Open it in a new browser window or tab: https://geoservices.leventhalmap.org/atlascope-custom-tour-generator/
2. Back in your Google Sheet, select the “Share” button, make sure that Link Sharing is “on,” and then copy the shareable link to your Google Sheet 
3. In the Create a custom Atlascope tour tool, paste the shared link to your Google Sheet in the first box 
4. In the second box, “Tour Identifier,” choose an identifier for your story. This will become part of your tour’s URL, and it shouldn’t have spaces. For instance, if you choose “boston-public-garden” as your identifier, the final story will have the URL “https://geoservices.leventhalmap.org/map-stories/#boston-public-garden” 

>NOTE: If you choose the same identifier as an existing tour, running this tool will UPDATE the tour rather than creating a new one. This is how you edit an existing tour. 

5. In the third and fourth boxes, type the name of your story and the author name. 
6. Click the “Generate” button, and, if everything goes correctly, you should get a tour URL created for you!
