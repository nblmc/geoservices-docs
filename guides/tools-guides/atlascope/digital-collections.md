## Using Atlascope to find source BPL collections {docsify-ignore}

While using mosaiced atlas layers inside the Atlascope app is an intuitive way to access the materials, we understand there will certainly be cases where you wish to access high-resolution scans of individual atlas pages, and thus will need to be able to locate these unique items in our [digital collections](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/ "Digital collections").

Or maybe, you even wish to visit the Map Center, and [research](https://www.leventhalmap.org/research/ "Research @ LMEC") with particular atlas pages in person!

For these reasons, Atlascope works symbiotically with our traditional library interfaces, specifically our digital collections and collection-level research guides for the historical urban atlas collection.

In this guide you will learn how to use Atlascope to quickly find atlas plates in the digital collections, download high-resolution images of the maps, or build a citation for any given plate. 

### Use Atlascope to find a plate in the digital collections {docsify-ignore}

1. Use the map or address search to find a location in [Atlascope](https://atlascope.leventhalmap.org/ "Atlascope"). 
2. Zoom in to the area of interest. 
3. Check the layer menu to ensure you have the correct year and publisher selected.
4. From the app layer controls, select "About this map"
5. Observe the bibliographic information for this volume, and options for finding this resource in the library collections.

#### View plate boundaries and atlas extent {docsify-ignore}

This option will take you to a page displaying only the layer for the one atlas volume you have selected, and a blue/green outline showing which coverage each page represents. 

![extent](https://geoservices.leventhalmap.org/docs/media/img/extent.png)

When you click on a page boundary, a popup will appear with bibliographic information about that atlas plate, including the digital collections identifier #, and a link to the item in the digital collections.

#### View list of plates in the Digital Collections {docsify-ignore}

This option will bring you to a query in the digital collections returning all results associated with that atlas's call number. This will essentially be a gallery of thumbnails. You will still need to page through the results to find the plate with the location of interest.

> *Hint:* Viewing the list of plates in the digital collections is a great way to locate the index page for any given atlas. You may want to use the index page to find that atlas's symbology key. Each publisher uses different colors and markings, so the legend on the index page can be helpful.


#### Find this plate in the Digital Collections {docsify-ignore}
This option will bring you to a page with only that atlas layer again, but this time, it will be zoomed in on the area you had been engaging with in Atlascope. 

This is generally the best way to find a specific plate in the digital collections, as this tool will remember where you were looking in Atlascope, and bring you right to that item in the digital collections. 

1. After clicking "Find this plate in Digital Collections," click on the exact area you are looking for, and a popup should appear with bibliographic information.

2. At the bottom of the popup, click "View this plate in digital collections"


3. To download a high-resolution scan, navigate to `Downloads` and select `Master (full resolution, uncompressed)`

4. To cite this plate, select "Cite". A citation will be automatically generated.




## All atlases @ BPL {docsify-ignore}

### Atlases not included in Atlascope {docsify-ignore}

While Atlascope includes an amazing number of atlases from the BPL collections covering Boston and surrounding towns, it does not include a significant portion of atlases available for research at the BPL.
> **Atlases not in Atlascope** <br>
> - Atlases outside of Boston Proper for most towns in Massachusetts - *If you would like to support expanding the geography, please contact us.*
>
> - Atlases published after 1923 where rights are still retained by the copyright owner. This includes most of the twentieth-century Sanborns.

### Coming in to research {docsify-ignore}

Though you cannot access these important archives in Atlascope or the digital collections quite yet, you **_can_** research with them in person. Here's how:

1). Submit a reference request using our [research form.](https://www.leventhalmap.org/research/ "Research @ LMEC")

2). Use our libguides to find a complete record of what's available.


### Using the libguides {docsify-ignore}

> Libguides → http://guides.bpl.org/urban-atlases
>
> The **BPL Urban Atlases Libguides** provide a comprehensive citation of every urban atlas available within the state of Massachusetts at the BPL.
> 
> Here we will describe how to use the libguides to determine the best way to access any given atlas, depending on the following factors:<br>
> **→** Whether or not it has been digitized and added to the Digital Collections and <br>
> **→** Whether or not it has already been added to Atlascope <br>
> **→**  Whether it is still under copyright and must be accessed in person.



Navigate to the [Historical Urban Atlases of Boston Libguide.](https://guides.bpl.org/urban-atlases "Urban Atlas Libguide")


To find a list of citations for all urban atlases available at the Boston Public Library, organized by neighborhood and chronology, select `List of Urban Atlases`.

In addition to this comprehensive citation list of every atlas available at the Boston Public Library, the Boston area libguide has a tab `Find by Map` which visually displays records for all Boston atlases and places them on a map interface, grouped by neighborhood. Many of these atlases have been digitized and added to Atlascope already, while others are still pending processing, or cannot be digitized yet because they are under copyright. 

Choosing an atlas from the neighborhood map menu dropdown will let you know the best way to access that item.

If you add a menu item for something that has been added to Atlascope, a link will appear that will bring you to that item in Atlascope. If you select a menu item that has not yet been added to Atlascope, a boundary extent layer will appear on the map, giving you useful bibliographic popup information about each atlas plate as a placeholder until we are able to extend direct access to the mosaiced imagery. 


If you are looking for towns outside of Boston, from the guides.bpl.org/urban-atlases page, navigate to **Related Resources** tab on the left, select `Historical Urban Atlases of Massachusetts Towns @ the BPL`.


This will bring you to a complete listing of historical town atlases available for research at the BPL. They are organized by County.

For questions related to researching with the BPL holdings, please do not hesitate to get in touch via our [research form](https://www.leventhalmap.org/research/ "Research @ LMEC") or via email at reference@leventhalmap.org.
