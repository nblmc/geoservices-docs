## Picking a service

When looking for US census data with the goal of making a map, we recommend using the data portal maintained by the Minnesota Population Center, NHGIS (The National Historic GIS). This data portal has many advantages over official census products like American Fact Finder. It has been designed specifically for use with mapping. The statistical demographic data available via NHGIS is formatted to make joining with geography files simple, by including a field "GISJOIN" in every file. It also includes historical boundary files for every census year, beginning with 1790, so that if you want to make a map of how areas have changed demographically over time, you can easily find boundaries complementary to the historic statistical information.
