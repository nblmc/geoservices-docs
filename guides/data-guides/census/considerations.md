## Picking a service

When looking for US census data with the goal of making a map, we recommend using the data portal maintained by the Minnesota Population Center, NHGIS (The National Historic GIS). This data portal has many advantages over official census products like American Fact Finder. It has been designed specifically for use with mapping. The statistical demographic data available via NHGIS is formatted to make joining with geography files simple, by including a field "GISJOIN" in every file. It also includes historical boundary files for every census year, beginning with 1790, so that if you want to make a map of how areas have changed demographically over time, you can easily find boundaries complementary to the historic statistical information.

## Data facets

The NHGIS portal is formatted like an online shopping cart. You will narrow down all available data by applying facets, and then add your desired datasets to your "cart" and "check them out", i.e. download the data. 

You will want to use at least the top 3 facets, "Geographic Levels," "Years," and "Topics" to narrow it down.


After you have selected one facet, NGHIS will dim out any unavailable options for the other facets, based on other categories you have selected. For example, if we were interested in making a map about populations of enslaved people in the early 1800s using census data, and had selected "slavery" as our first **topic** facet, when we went to choose from **year** options, we would only be able to select data from narrow census years between 1790 and 1860, when the Census Bureau collected information about the United States' enslaved population. 


Age, being a "core" demographic that has been gathered from the first census up present day, can be found in every census year.

## Years 


An important factor to be aware of is the difference between the total count decennial census and the rolling, continual sample data constantly being collected called the American Community Survey.

The United States Census Bureau attempts to collect as complete a total population count as possible every ten years, and has done so since 1790. Because we are so close at the time this guide was written (Spring 2020) to our next full count, it means the data from our last total count (2010) is pretty outdated by now.

In the every-ten-year censuses, only a handful of core demographic questions are asked, and they are theoretically asked of every person living in the United States. You may notice how short the census are from when you filled out your own 2020 census. It should have only taken about 5 - 10 minutes. 

The census **also** collections much more detailed, long-form data. This data, however, is not gathered about every single person, rather, it is gathered about **sample populations**. This is called the American Community Survey. Some pros to the ACS are that the data are much more recent and frequent than the decennial censuses, and more detailed questions are asked of respondents. A major con is that because the data are **sample data**, they are less reliable than the full decennial counts, sometimes having significantly high [margins of error](https://www.statisticssolutions.com/how-does-margin-of-error-work/ "margins of error").
