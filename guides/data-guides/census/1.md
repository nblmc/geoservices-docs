## Data Filters {docsify-ignore}

1. Select **Topics** from the filter menu. 

2. We are interested in age, so select **Age** under **Core Demographics**, by clicking the green plus sign. 

Based on our filtering so far, there are 10,067 tables of data and 1,396 geography files available.

3. To further narrow down the data tables and geography files to only the most recent, select the filter **Years**. 


4. Select the most recent year available, **2018**. You could also select the five-year range, **2014-2018**. Click submit.

There are now 672 tables of data and 85 geography files available.

7. Click through to page 5 of the results and find dataset "Population Under 18 Years by Age". 


You will need to use the datasets' title descriptions and classification breakdowns to determine which datasets are of most use to your project.

In this case, we were looking for population data broken into different age brackets, because we were interested in evaluating the impact of library locations on different school-age populations.

You can learn more about each dataset's classfication by clicking on the variable name under the column "Classifications"

!>  Under Classifications, click **Age(8)**

![age](https://geoservices.leventhalmap.org/docs/media/img/age.png)


Upon clicking on the age variable's classification breakdown, the data appears to be categorized into age brackets: under 3 years, 3-4 years, 5 years, 6-8 years, 9-11 years, and so on. This looks promising. Let's download this dataset.
