# Public Instruction in Cartography and GIS Guides Homepage

Exploring the vast collection of maps, geospatial data, and geographic information that are available today requires familiarity with digial file formats, data repositories, and specialized software. We seek to empower you with the ability to work with digital maps, and offer instructional programs designed to introduce a variety of digital mapmaking skills.

These guides will serve as a homebase for our public instruction sessions, letting you know which programs are currently running or being developed, and providing a centralized location for all of the online materials that accompany the workshops. 

## Winter-Spring 2020 Curriculum {docsify-ignore}

### **Mapmaking 101: Introduction to Mapmaking** {docsify-ignore} <br>

### **Mapmaking 102: Principles of Cartography**  {docsify-ignore} <br>
This course extends the basic skills of mapmaking to include visual questions around symbolization, labeling, colors and layout. 


### **Mapmaking 201: Basic Mapmaking in Python**  {docsify-ignore} <br>
This course offers a simple introduction to the Python programming language for creating maps using code, rather than a visual software interface. It also includes basic methods for collecting and cleaning data sets from the web. 


## Requirements {docsify-ignore}

Mapmaking 101 is taught for those with no prior experience in digital mapping, though patrons should have a basic familiarity with downloading files from the web. All other courses require Mapmaking 101 as a prerequisite, or else prior experience with digital maps.

## Schedule and Registration {docsify-ignore}

We offer Mapmaking 101 roughly twice a month, and at least one other advanced course each month. For a current list of upcoming course offerings, check the guide pages for that offering, or our [calendar](https://www.leventhalmap.org/calendar "calendar"). Most courses are capped at a dozen participants, and pre-registration is opened several weeks in advanced through Eventbrite. Waiting lists are available for those who miss the initial registration limit. All of our regular instructional programs are free and open to the public. Unless otherwise noted, courses are offered in the instructional computer lab on the mezzanine level of the Johnson Building at the Central Library in Copley Square.
