# Simple Map Making in Python

This workshop is taught using Jupyter notebooks. Jupyter notebooks allow us to dynamically code as a group in the browser. Binder (a Jupyter product) allows us to establish dependencies beforehand we can use in the classroom without having to install anything on our computers during the workshop.

To deploy the workshop materials in a browser, please navigate through the following steps:

1). In a browser (Chrome, Firefox or Safari), navigate to [Binder.](https://mybinder.org/ "Binder")

2). Note the form field to build from an existent Github repository.

3). Enter the following URL into this field, and select `Launch`

```shell
https://github.com/brankominick/Leaflet-maps
```

This may take a few moments to launch.

When the page has launched successfully, you will have access to all workshop materials, and be able to follow along with the workshop steps, creating web maps using Python!

Selecting `tutorial.ipynb` will allow you to follow along with the workshop steps, and play around with the code inside the notebook.
