## Description 
This course offers a simple introduction to the Python programming language for creating maps using code, rather than a visual software interface. It also includes basic methods for collecting and cleaning data sets from the web.

## Working at Home
One of the simplest way to complete these workshops at home is by working in your web browser! To work online, navigate to [MyBinder](https://mybinder.org/). You should see a box that looks like this: ![mybinder](media/img/mybinder.png)

Copy and paste the github url for [LMEC workshops](https://github.com/nblmc/workshops) into that space and press the launch button. It may take a while to setup. 

After everything is finished loading, you should see a webpage with a folder for map 201 ![map201mybinder](media/img/map201mybinder.png) Explore this folder and find a lesson that you'd like to work on. Click on an ipynb file to open up the tutorial for that lesson. If you're not familiar with Python or Jupyter, try starting out with basics.ipynb.

Data Cleaning with Maps

#### Geocoding
*Address to geographic coordinates*  

*Often, you will find that your data contains a street address without coordinates.  In order to place these points on a leaflet map, you will need to reformat these locations as latitude and longitude.*

We will use:
- [Nominatim](https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/) is a free search engine for OpenStreetMap data.
- [GeoPy](https://geopy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) allows you to easily use third party geocoders in python.

#### ** Example **

```from geopy.geocoders import Nominatim    
from geopy.extra.rate_limiter import RateLimiter #optional for our purposes 

geolocator = Nominatim(user_agent='app_name')

#One Address
location = geolocator.geocode('')

#Loop through Addresses
for place in places
    try:
        coordinates = geolocator.geocode(place.address)
    except Exception:
        pass
    print(coordinates)
```
